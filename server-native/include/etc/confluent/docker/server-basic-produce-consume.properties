############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=1

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on. If not configured, the host name will be equal to the value of
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName(), with PLAINTEXT listener name, and port 9092.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
#listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092

# Listener name, hostname and port the broker will advertise to clients.
# If not set, it uses the value for "listeners".
#advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092

# Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
#listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network
num.network.threads=3

# The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600


############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/var/lib/kafka/data
kafka.logs.dir=/var/lib/kafka/data
# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=1

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=1

############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################
# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics "__consumer_offsets" and "__transaction_state"
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended to ensure availability such as 3.
offsets.topic.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.min.isr=1

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
#log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
#log.flush.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours=168

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
#log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
#zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
#zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=18000

##################### Confluent Metrics Reporter #######################
# Confluent Control Center and Confluent Auto Data Balancer integration
#
# Uncomment the following lines to publish monitoring data for
# Confluent Control Center and Confluent Auto Data Balancer
# If you are using a dedicated metrics cluster, also adjust the settings
# to point to your metrics kakfa cluster.
#metric.reporters=io.confluent.metrics.reporter.ConfluentMetricsReporter
#confluent.metrics.reporter.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
#
# Uncomment the following line if the metrics cluster has a single broker
#confluent.metrics.reporter.topic.replicas=1

############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################

# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.
# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.
# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.
# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.
group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms=0


############################# Confluent Authorizer Settings  #############################

# Uncomment to enable Confluent Authorizer with support for ACLs, LDAP groups and RBAC
#authorizer.class.name=io.confluent.kafka.security.authorizer.ConfluentServerAuthorizer
# Semi-colon separated list of super users in the format <principalType>:<principalName>

############################# Confluent Data Balancer Settings  #############################

# The Confluent Data Balancer is used to measure the load across the Kafka cluster and move data
# around as necessary. Comment out this line to disable the Data Balancer.
confluent.balancer.enable=false

# By default, the Data Balancer will only move data when an empty broker (one with no partitions on it)
# is added to the cluster or a broker failure is detected. Comment out this line to allow the Data
# Balancer to balance load across the cluster whenever an imbalance is detected.
#confluent.balancer.heal.uneven.load.trigger=ANY_UNEVEN_LOAD

# The default time to declare a broker permanently failed is 1 hour (3600000 ms).
# Uncomment this line to turn off broker failure detection, or adjust the threshold
# to change the duration before a broker is declared failed.
#confluent.balancer.heal.broker.failure.threshold.ms=-1

# Edit and uncomment the following line to limit the network bandwidth used by data balancing operations.
# This value is in bytes/sec/broker. The default is 10MB/sec.
#confluent.balancer.throttle.bytes.per.second=10485760

# Capacity Limits -- when set to positive values, the Data Balancer will attempt to keep
# resource usage per-broker below these limits.
# Edit and uncomment this line to limit the maximum number of replicas per broker. Default is unlimited.
#confluent.balancer.max.replicas=10000

# Edit and uncomment this line to limit what fraction of the log disk (0-1.0) is used before rebalancing.
# The default (below) is 85% of the log disk.
#confluent.balancer.disk.max.load=0.85

# Edit and uncomment these lines to define a maximum network capacity per broker, in bytes per
# second. The Data Balancer will attempt to ensure that brokers are using less than this amount
# of network bandwidth when rebalancing.
# Here, 10MB/s. The default is unlimited capacity.
#confluent.balancer.network.in.max.bytes.per.second=10485760
#confluent.balancer.network.out.max.bytes.per.second=10485760

# Edit and uncomment this line to identify specific topics that should not be moved by the data balancer.
# Removal operations always move topics regardless of this setting.
#confluent.balancer.exclude.topic.names=

# Edit and uncomment this line to identify topic prefixes that should not be moved by the data balancer.
# (For example, a "confluent.balancer" prefix will match all of "confluent.balancer.a", "confluent.balancer.b",
# "confluent.balancer.c", and so on.)
# Removal operations always move topics regardless of this setting.
#confluent.balancer.exclude.topic.prefixes=

# The replication factor for the topics the Data Balancer uses to store internal state.
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended to ensure availability.
# The default value is 3.
confluent.balancer.topic.replication.factor=1
