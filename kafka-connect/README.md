# Confluent Docker Image for Kafka Connect

Docker image for deploying and running the Kafka Connect. The source code is currently available on [Github](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/).

Please see the [Confluent Platform documentation](http://docs.confluent.io/current/cp-docker-images/docs/intro.html) for documentation on these images - including quickstart guides, Docker Compose configs, reference documentation and advanced tutorials.

Functionally, the cp-kafka-connect and the cp-kafka-connect-base images are identical. The only difference is that the cp-kafka-connect image already contains several of Confluentâ€™s connectors, whereas the cp-kafka-connect-base image comes with none by default.
